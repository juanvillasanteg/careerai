# CareerAI

## Project Overview

CareerAI is an interactive digital resume with an AI-powered conversational interface that allows users (potential employers, recruiters, connections) to explore a professional's experience through natural dialogue. Unlike traditional resumes or LinkedIn profiles, CareerAI enables dynamic information retrieval through conversations that feel like an interview with the professional.

## Goals and Objectives

1. Create a conversational AI that can accurately represent professional experience
2. Develop a system to retrieve relevant information from multiple data sources
3. Build an engaging and intuitive user interface for the conversation
4. Ensure accurate and contextual responses to professional questions
5. Provide a unique and memorable way to showcase professional experience

```

### Data Flow

1. User inputs a question about professional experience
2. Question is processed by the AI agent
3. Agent retrieves relevant information from data sources
4. Information is used to formulate a contextually appropriate response
5. Response is presented to the user through the interface
6. Conversation history is maintained to provide context for future exchanges

## Technology Stack

- **Language & Runtime**: Python 3.12.10
- **AI/LLM Framework**: LangChain for agent orchestration and retrieval
- **Data Processing**: Pandas and Polars for data manipulation
- **UI Framework**: Streamlit for web interface
- **Development Tools**: Ruff for linting, pytest for testing

## Data Sources

1. **Core Resume Data**:

   - JSON/YAML formatted resume data
   - Project descriptions
   - Skills and competencies

2. **Potential External Sources**:
   - LinkedIn profile (via API or structured export)
   - GitHub activity
   - Portfolio website content
   - Publications or articles

## AI Agent Design

The agent will be built using LangChain's agent framework with:

1. **Document Retrieval System**:

   - Vector-based retrieval for semantic search
   - Chunking and embedding of professional documents
   - Relevance scoring for query results

2. **Context Management**:

   - Maintenance of conversation history
   - Tracking of previously discussed topics
   - Memory mechanisms to avoid repetition

3. **Response Generation**:
   - Templated responses for common questions
   - Dynamic response generation for specific inquiries
   - Personality alignment with the professional's style

## User Experience Design

The UI will provide:

1. A clean chat interface reminiscent of a professional conversation
2. Profile information overview panel
3. Suggestions for possible questions to ask
4. Ability to download resume or connect to LinkedIn/GitHub
5. Mobile-friendly responsive design

## Documentation and Decision Records

The `docs/` directory contains detailed documentation on key decision topics. Before making a new implementation or architectural change, check the relevant files in `docs/` and update them as necessary. These documents cover:

- [System Architecture](docs/architecture.md)
- [Key Technical Decisions](docs/architecture.md)
- [Design Patterns in Use](docs/architecture.md)
- [Component Relationships](docs/architecture.md)
- [API Documentation](docs/api.md)
- [Data Model](docs/data_model.md)
- [Other relevant topics as the project evolves]

**Always consult and update these files to ensure consistency and traceability of major decisions.**

## Potential Challenges and Mitigations

| Challenge                           | Mitigation Strategy                                             |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Accuracy of information retrieval   | Implement validation mechanisms and confidence scoring          |
| Handling questions outside of scope | Clear communication of agent limitations and graceful fallbacks |
| Maintaining conversation context    | Implement robust conversation history and memory systems        |
| Data privacy considerations         | Clear documentation of data usage and security measures         |
| Deployment and hosting              | Containerization and cloud-ready deployment options             |

## Future Enhancements

1. Multi-language support
2. Voice interface option
3. Customizable agent personality
4. Integration with job application systems
5. Analytics for interview performance and common questions

## Success Metrics

The success of the project will be measured by:

1. Accuracy of responses to professional questions
2. Engagement metrics (conversation length, questions per session)
3. User satisfaction ratings
4. Conversion metrics (downloads, connections, etc.)
5. Technical performance (response time, error rates)
